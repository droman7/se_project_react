Sprint 14

Connecting frontend and backend: Fullstack Application

This project is a full-stack web application where users can register, log in, edit their profiles, and interact with clothing items by adding likes. It connects a React frontend to a custom backend API, handling authentication and user data through context. The app demonstrates key software engineering concepts like protected routes, dynamic rendering, and RESTful fetch requests.
